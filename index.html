    <h2> Introduction </h2>
          Over the course of the semester in English 3844, we completed three different projects where each one built upon the other. 
          First, we collected personal data “to explore, examine, and gain insight into your writing practices and how digital media and data permeate it.” 
          My interpretation of this project was to analyze how my mood changes after an interaction with the Instagram app. 
          Our second assignment was to create a data visualization of our data collection. 
          This was an unique assignment where we got to explore with different chart types and pick which one best fit our data. 
          After our data visualization, we created an “Explained” video in order to explain how our data relates to a broader societal issue. 
          I chose to explain how data mining and psychographics are used in relation to Instagram. 
          It’s important to understand how digital media is connected to societal issues. 
          Here is my datastory and how all of my projects create a comprehensive understanding of the digital world of Instagram.

          <h2> Data Visualization </h2>
      <p style= "width: 90%">
      	For the data visualization assignment we used Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) to create the visualization of our personal data collection. 
      	We used Inkscape to render our images into SVG files. 
      	For my dataviz, I created a categorical chart for multiple different reasons. 
      	First, I thought it best visually showed what I was trying to emphasize, what emotions I feel the most according to my location. 
      	I wanted to highlight this aspect of my data because I think it’s a unique element to consider - how your emotion is correlated with your location. 
      	I’ve used marks and attributes that amplify these patterns by using icons to represent my location. 
      	To be even more specific, I added icons to make it obvious where my location was, so it wasn’t just color coded. 
      	The emojis are obviously what emotion(s) I am feeling. 
      	The stars represent the number of likes I gave during an Instagram experience and the circles represent the number of comments I gave during the same experience. 
      	My final SVG is a good representation of what I am trying to visually emphasize through my personal data collection.

          <h2> Psychographics Explained Video </h2>
          The Explained video allowed us to interpret our data visualization and findings and translate them into a broader societal issue topic we wanted to emphasize. 
          The assignment was to select an issue linked to our digital media practice and how corporations and companies commodify the practice. 
          I chose to highlight how companies use psychographic data in order to categorize customers and track us based on our preferences. 
          Many individuals see this as an invasion of privacy, while I see their angle, I find it a fascinating evolution of how marketing is changing with the digital age. 
          After doing lengthy research, I was able to draw conclusions about the range data mining and psychographics play in companies customer categorization process.

    <h2> Social Practice </h2>
    Stemming off of my Explained video, data mining is a real concern among society to date. 
    Data mining technologies are creating psychographic profiles of people’s behaviors and habits where companies are able to categorize their customers into groups of how they can better frame their messages and target their audience. 
    The ultimate goal of data mining is prediction and companies and businesses use this as a way to take advantage of their customers by secretly tracking their history and trends they are involved with.
    Allen Nance, President of E-mail Marketing Communications of Mansell Group says, “[Data mining] shouldn’t be ethical to create a behavioral profile of someone you don’t interact with.”

    <h2> Now What? </h2>
	This type of information can all be traced back to the government’s regulation of Internet Privacy Protection. 
	This has recently been a controversial topic of discussion since in March 2017 the House of Representative voted to strip privacy protection from those who use the Internet. 
	President Trump signed the bill into a law in April 2017, companies who connect people to the Internet have the ability to collect and sell data mining results and psychographics findings of users without user permission. 
	This is completely unethical and a complete invasion of privacy.
